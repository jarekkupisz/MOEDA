Description: Targeted Exploratory Data Analysis (TEDA) is a novel approach to 
    EDA, which aims to make you quickly understand how useful your data is in 
    modelling a target variable. It generates a single graph of all groupings 
    in your dataset and automatically assesses their inferential utility. This 
    gives any data analyst or scientist an immediate feel of what can be 
    expected from the data when taken through ML or statistical modelling 
    initiatives. It addresses the main shortcomings of traditional EDA which 
    tells you what the data is (how many variables of each type, how many 
    nulls, etc.) instead of how useful it is. TEDA also challenges “automatic” 
    EDA approaches, which really only automate the creation of dozens of charts 
    without immediately surfacing the cons and pros of your explanatory 
    variables.
