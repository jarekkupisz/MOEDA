Description: Modeling-Oriented Exploratory Data Analysis (MOEDA) is a novel 
  approach to EDA, which aims to make you quickly understand how useful your 
  data is in modelling a target variable. This gives any data analyst or 
  scientist an immediate feel of what can be expected from the data when taken 
  through ML or statistical modelling initiatives. It addresses the main 
  shortcomings of traditional EDA which tells you what the data is (how many 
  variables of each type, how many nulls, etc.) instead of how useful it is. 
  MOEDA also challenges “automatic” EDA approaches, which only automate the 
  creation of dozens of charts without immediately surfacing the cons and 
  pros of your explanatory variables.
